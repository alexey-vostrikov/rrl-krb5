# Run a cargo command for this fork inside the pinned toolchain image.
#
# Copied from the sibling `rust-kdc` project, where the same problem was solved once for the
# same reason: the host has no Rust, and a build that works here must be the build that gates.
#
# The host has no Rust and should not: the compiler is the image tag, which is
# the same thing CI uses (`rust:1.99.1-bullseye`), so a build that works here
# works there and a version drift is impossible rather than unlikely.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/cargo.sh test
#   scripts/cargo.sh clippy --all-targets --features crypto-rskrb5 -- -D warnings
#
# Two details that are load-bearing:
#
# * `-u $(id -u):$(id -g)` — without it the container writes `target/` as root
#   and the next run on the host cannot clean it up.
# * `CARGO_HOME` and `RUSTUP_HOME` inside a writable mount — the image's homes
#   are root-owned, and a user cannot write the registry cache into them.
# * `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` keyed by the image tag. Cargo decides what to rebuild from
#   timestamps, not from libc: switching the base from bookworm to bullseye reuses
#   objects linked against glibc 2.36 and produces binaries that die on the stand
#   with "version `GLIBC_2.34' not found" — or, worse, a green test run against a
#   binary the repository does not build. A separate directory per image makes the
#   two bases unable to see each other's work.

# `CARGO_HOME` per image tag as well as `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`. A shared home mixes
# `$CARGO_HOME/bin` between bases, and cargo resolves a subcommand through that directory
# first: a `cargo-llvm-cov` installed on bookworm shadows the image's own and dies on bullseye
# with "version `GLIBC_2.34' not found". The registry cache costs a second download once.
